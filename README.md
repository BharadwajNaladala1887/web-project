Project Report: Social Networking Platform
Overview

The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack will be used in this project to create a social networking platform. 
The platform has tools for managing profiles, uploading content, social media connections, and user authentication.


Features

The authentication of users
Become a new user by registering.
For current users, log in.
JWT token-based authentication based on context.
User Profile Administration
User profiles can be created and edited.
Control the details on your profile.
Content Organizing
Upload pictures and text.
Rewrite and oversee postings.
Like, comment on, and share posts.
You can follow or unfollow other users.
Explore and Engage
Look for other users on the network.
Use the feature to follow and unfollow.

Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

Backend (Node.js with Express)
server.js: Entry point for the server.
config/: Configuration files for database and JWT.
models/: Mongoose models for MongoDB collections.
routes/: Express routes for handling requests.
controllers/: Functions to manage request handling.
middlewares/: Custom middleware for tasks such as authentication.
utils/: Utility functions like validation.
Frontend (React)
src/
components/: Reusable React components.
pages/: Different pages (Signup, Signin, Home, Profile).
utils/: Utility functions like API calls.
App.js: Main App component.
index.js: Entry point for React.
Pages and Components

Register or Login
Create an account form for new users using SignupPage.js.
Existing users can log in using the SigninPage.js form.
Main Page
User postings and interactions are shown in HomePage.js.
A component to show individual posts is called PostComponent.js.
The Profile Page
ProfilePage.js: Shows the user profile and provides editing capabilities.
EditProfileComponent.js: An editable component for profile data.
Following Management
The component for creating new posts is called CreatePostComponent.js.
The EditPostComponent.js component allows you to edit posts that already exist.
Social Engagement
Users are able to look for other members using SearchComponent.js.
FollowComponent.js: Controls user following and unfollowing.
Validation


JWT Tokens: Used for context-based authentication, ensuring secure access to user-specific features.

how to run the project: 
clone the repositary 
open yur desired platform
go to project
open terminal -
  -cd backend
  -npm install
  -npm start
make sure to keep you environmental variables in .env files 
PORT=""
MONGODB_URI=
JWT_SECRET=secretkey

  2) open new terminal
     - cd frontend
     - npm install
     - npm start

Conclusion

This social networking platform provides a comprehensive set of features for user interaction and content management. The use of the MERN stack ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase, with clear separation of concerns between the backend and frontend.
